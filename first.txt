Mini apple pies
https://blog.freshdirect.com/mini-apple-pies-recipe/

Everything is better in bite-sized portions, even pie. We think these miniature versions would be perfect for breakfast—they do have fruit in them!—or as a sweet treat post-Thanksgiving dinner. If you’re feeling adventurous, swap out apples for pears or even add a bit of pumpkin puree for an even more in-season treat.

What You’ll Need:
1-2 apples
1 package of crescent rolls
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons cinnamon
Melted butter

What to Do:
Grease a cookie sheet and pre-heat your oven based on the crescent roll instructions.

Remove crescent rolls from the package and cut the individual rolls in half. Put them on the cookie sheet.

Cut apples into bite-size slices.

Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and set aside. Using a brush (if you don’t have a brush, a spoon will work), apply a layer of melted butter on the crescent rolls. Then, apply a generous layer of the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture.

Place an apple slice on the large side of each crescent roll. Then, roll the dough around the apple. Add more melted butter and cinnamon sugar.

Bake the apple rolls for 12-15 minutes or until the rolls have baked through. Let cool and serve, or save for your next holiday party!
